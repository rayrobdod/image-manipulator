## Build Instructions
This repository uses [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) as its build tool.

Aside from that, one of the dependencies, https://github.com/rayrobdod/utilities,
isn't in a maven-ivy-whatever thing, so you'd have to publish-local the correct
version of that before attempting to compile this.
